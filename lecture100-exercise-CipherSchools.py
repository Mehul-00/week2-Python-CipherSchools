# define a function which will take list as a argument and this function
# will return a reversed list

# exercise 
# [1,2,3,4] ---> [4,3,2,1,] 
# ['word1', 'word2'] ----> ['word2' , 'word1']

# Note you simply do this with reverse method or [::-1]

# but try to do this with the help of append and pop method
